Feature: StreetReporter
	As a town planner, 
	I want to display a report for streets
	So that I can keep track of the house numbers

Scenario: Add two numbers
	Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
	And I have entered 70 into the calculator
	When I press add
	Then the result should be 120 on the screen
